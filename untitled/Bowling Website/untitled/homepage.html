<h2>Why we came about</h2>
<p>With the rising numbers of people joining bowling teams, teens and young kids are faced with the problem
of the cost of everything you need to buy. From jerseys to bowling balls to shoes, all of that can really add
up. Bowling buddies is here for beginner bowlers to find a place they can get free or very reduced priced gear.
On our website you can find links and pages to bowling balls that might be on the market for 200 being priced at 100 or lower.
I'd call that a good deal! Our main focus is to help new bowlers get their foot in the door and be prepared for the
lifetime that can come with bowling!</p>
    <h2>Our Events</h2>
    <p>If you can't order online or dont want to, come to us! We will be having multiple times you can come to
        our event to try on and see what you like instead of the fear for buying things online. With having these
        events there will be things that we sell online that we might not have at those events. You will be able
        try things on and see what fits. Come and have some fun!</p>
